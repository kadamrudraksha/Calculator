Creating a basic calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is an excellent beginner project for those learning web development. It involves building a user-friendly interface using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the logic that performs the calculations. This project not only helps you understand how to create interactive web applications but also allows you to explore key concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic arithmetic operations in JavaScript.

Here's what the process involves:

1. **HTML (Structure)**: We'll create the basic layout of the calculator, including the display screen and buttons for digits, operators, and functionalities like clear and equals.
2. **CSS (Styling)**: We'll apply styles to ensure the calculator looks neat and is responsive across devices. This includes button alignment, font sizes, colors, and overall layout.
3. **JavaScript (Functionality)**: The core functionality of the calculator, such as handling button clicks, performing arithmetic operations, and displaying results, will be written in JavaScript.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a simple, functional calculator that performs basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division!
